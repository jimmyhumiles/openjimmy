I make it on 12 Feb. when i am a undercollege.
I upload my first open source web page file with the aid of AI. It can add what you want to do in the page and it can save in the browser. I make it because of my poor memory about what to do with my girlfriend. Thanks to the video https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FPCzYdEeH/?spm_id_from=333.1387.favlist.content.click&vd_source=9460430b5670ef15857324288fcdb75a and the help of ai which named doubao.
On 20th Feb., i upload a tkinter code to help me run ollama in a Visual interface without using command prompt. Without doubao's hlep, i can't finish it. You can download it to further optimize it.
